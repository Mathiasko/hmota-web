You lose yourself and you don’t even know how it happens. Looking in the mirror scares you, because you see in your eyes everything that you try so hard to suffocate inside. All the mistakes, the failed attempts, the people who left you when you needed them. Be the one you need by your side. Be yourself the person you need. You are “just” a person. Let all your sadness and stress drown in the lake not far from the house on a sunny summer day. Find time for your soul. What looks like a disaster today, maybe in a few months, will be a grain of sand compared to the happiness that awaits you. Today is an ordinary day. Ordinary date. In a few years, however, you can fly on this day to your dream vacation, celebrate your child’s birthday or celebrate the 5th wedding anniversary and be happier than ever before.',

Because your smile when looking at the sunset, your puppy or your favorite food is different and brighter than the others. Were you broken? Did the world hurt you? So let your wounds be flooded with gold and look beautiful and unique. Because with your gold you are yourself, your experiences, joys and worries. Are you weak Are you emotional? Are you looking forward to it? Are you shy … Whatever you are, you are yourself today and you will never be the same. Love it while you are, where you are, with whom you are, and know that every day we are more beautiful than ever.',

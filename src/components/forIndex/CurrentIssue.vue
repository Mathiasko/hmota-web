      <p>
        A dreamy issue about capturing the fragments of time and individual
        moments that make up eternity. üí´ They are fragile, fleeting, but also
        endless. In our new issue you will find: - Interview about photography
        and reportage with Andrej B√°n - An article about important moments in
        the history of art - Speed and feelings in dance through the eyes of
        dancers - Reportage literature as an authentic form of reference -
        Review of the book Atlas of Forgetting by Petr Kri≈°t√∫fek - Portrait of
        director √Ågnes Varda - Instructions from our Karla: how to develop a
        film in the comfort of your home And much more!
